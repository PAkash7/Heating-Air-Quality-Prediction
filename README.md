# Heating-Air-Quality-Prediction
- Generates synthetic datasets (temperature, heating load, humidity, PM2.5) with different sequences/patterns - Trains simple models for heating demand (regression) and air quality (regression/classification example) - Produces multiple plots: time series, rolling averages, scatter, correlation heatmap, forecast vs actual
